## Creative Attitude Associates

A simple 5 page HTML, CSS website I developed while taking a course for front-end Web Development and Web Designing from <a href="https://www.theearningacademy.com/">The Earning Academy Pakistan</a>.
It was created as a mid course assignment for that course.

The <a href="https://github.com/abdullahmansoor727/mykart">final assignment</a> is an improved version which is an e-commerce website with Javascript and JQuery included for interactivity.

That website is also mobile responsive.

However this assignment was a learning experience and helped me build and strengthen my HTML and CSS basics.
